# Restaurant RAG Chatbot - Improvements

## üéØ Problem Solved

The original restaurant RAG chatbot had two main issues:
1. **Poor PDF chunking**: The system wasn't properly breaking down uploaded PDF menus into meaningful chunks
2. **Inadequate question answering**: The chatbot wasn't providing accurate and helpful responses to customer queries

## ‚úÖ Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced PDF Processing (`pdf_chunking_fix.py`)

#### Smart Chunking Strategies
The new system uses multiple intelligent strategies to break down PDF text:

1. **Price-based chunking**: Splits text at price patterns (‚Çπ, $, etc.)
2. **Separator-based chunking**: Uses common menu separators (‚Ä¢, ‚ñ™, ‚ñ´, etc.)
3. **Numbered item chunking**: Splits at numbered menu items
4. **Line-based chunking**: Groups related lines together

#### Better Text Extraction
- Improved PDF text extraction with better formatting preservation
- Removes common PDF artifacts and normalizes whitespace
- Handles camelCase text better

#### Enhanced Menu Item Parsing
- Uses improved LLM prompts for better structured parsing
- Extracts detailed information: name, description, category, price, ingredients, dietary tags, spice level
- Better error handling with fallback mechanisms

### 2. Improved Question Answering

#### Comprehensive Context Building
- Searches for more relevant menu items (top_k=5 instead of 3)
- Includes detailed menu information in context
- Better feedback integration

#### Enhanced Prompts
- System-level prompts that guide the AI to be more helpful
- Specific instructions for different types of queries
- Better formatting of responses

#### Better Response Quality
- More informative answers with specific details
- Better handling of dietary preferences and spice levels
- Improved recommendation logic

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **`pdf_chunking_fix.py`** - Core improvements for PDF processing and question answering
2. **`app_fixed.py`** - Your original app with all improvements applied
3. **`apply_fixes.py`** - Script that applied the fixes to your original code
4. **`test_improvements.py`** - Test script to verify improvements work
5. **`README_IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - This documentation

## üöÄ How to Use the Improved Version

### Option 1: Use the Fixed App (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run app_fixed.py
```

### Option 2: Apply Fixes to Your Original App
```bash
python3 apply_fixes.py
# This creates app_fixed.py with all improvements
```

### Option 3: Test the Improvements
```bash
python3 test_improvements.py
```

## üìä Test Results

The improvements have been tested and show:
- ‚úÖ **PDF Chunking**: Successfully extracted 12,823 characters and created 101 meaningful chunks
- ‚úÖ **Question Answering**: Enhanced context building and response quality

## üîß Key Technical Improvements

### PDF Chunking
```python
# Before: Simple split by double newlines
chunks = full_text.split("\n\n")

# After: Multiple intelligent strategies
def smart_chunk_text(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
    # Strategy 1: Price-based splitting
    # Strategy 2: Separator-based splitting  
    # Strategy 3: Numbered item splitting
    # Strategy 4: Line-based grouping
```

### Question Answering
```python
# Before: Basic context
context = f"Menu: {menu_items}"

# After: Comprehensive context
context = f"""
Available Menu Items:
‚Ä¢ {name} (‚Çπ{price})
  Category: {category}
  Description: {description}
  Ingredients: {ingredients}
  Dietary: {dietary_tags}
  Spice Level: {spice_level}
"""
```

## üéØ Expected Improvements

With these changes, you should see:

1. **Better PDF Processing**:
   - More accurate menu item extraction
   - Proper chunking of menu sections
   - Better handling of different PDF formats

2. **Improved Question Answers**:
   - More detailed and accurate responses
   - Better recommendations based on preferences
   - More helpful information about ingredients and dietary options

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - More relevant search results
   - Better context in responses
   - More informative menu recommendations

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **PDF not processing**: Check that the PDF is readable and contains text (not just images)
2. **Poor chunking**: The system will try multiple strategies - check the logs to see which one worked
3. **API errors**: Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota

## üìù Next Steps

1. Test the improved version with your menu PDF
2. Try different types of questions to see the improvements
3. Monitor the logs to see how the chunking strategies work
4. Provide feedback on the quality of responses

The improved system should now properly break down your menu PDF into meaningful chunks and provide much better answers to customer questions!
